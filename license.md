Delivery of the Licensed Applications to Apple

2.1
You will deliver to Apple, at Your sole expense, using the App Store Connect tool or other mechanism
provided by Apple, the Licensed Applications, Licensed Application Information and associated metadata, in a
format and manner prescribed by Apple, as required for the delivery of the Licensed Applications to End-Users
in accordance with this Schedule 2. Metadata You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 2 will include: (i) the
title and version number of each of the Licensed Applications; (ii) the regions You designate, in which You wish
Apple to allow End-Users to download those Licensed Applications; (iii) any copyright or other intellectual
property rights notices; (iv) Your privacy policy; (v) Your End-User license agreement (“EULA”), if any, in
accordance with Section 4.2 of this Schedule 2; and (vi) any additional metadata set forth in the Documentation
and/or the App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time, including metadata designed to
enhance search and discovery of content on Apple-branded hardware.
2.2
All Licensed Applications will be delivered by You to Apple using software tools, a secure FTP site
address and/or such other delivery methods as prescribed by Apple.
v123
28 August 2023

You hereby certify that all of the Licensed Applications You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 2 are
2.3
authorized for export from the United States to each of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the
requirements of all applicable laws, including but not limited to the United States Export Administration
Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774. You further represent and warrant that all versions of the Licensed
Applications You deliver to Apple are not subject to the International Traffic In Arms Regulations 22 C.F.R.
Parts 120-130 and are not designed, made, modified or configured for any military end users or end uses.
Without limiting the generality of this Section 2.3, You certify that (i) none of the Licensed Applications contains,
uses or supports any data encryption or cryptographic functions; or (ii) in the event that any Licensed
Application contains, uses or supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You certify that
You have complied with the United States Export Administration Regulations, and are in possession of, and will
upon request provide Apple with, PDF copies of export classification ruling (CCATS) issued by the United
States Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) or any self-classification reports
submitted to the BIS, and appropriate authorizations from other regions that mandate import authorizations for
that Licensed Application, as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this
Section 2.3 in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications under this Schedule 2.
Except as provided in this Section 2.3, Apple will be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the
Export Administration Regulations in allowing End-Users to access and download the Licensed Applications
under this Schedule 2.
2.4
You shall be responsible for determining and implementing any age ratings or parental advisory
warnings required by the applicable government regulations, ratings board(s), service(s), or other organizations
(each a “Ratings Board”) for any video, television, gaming or other content offered in Your Licensed Application
for each locality in the Territory. Where applicable, You shall also be responsible for providing any content
restriction tools or age verification functionality before enabling end-users to access mature or otherwise
regulated content within Your Licensed Application.
3.

Delivery of the Licensed Applications to End-Users

3.1
You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for
You, is hosting, or pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this Schedule 2 may enable authorized third parties to host, the
Licensed Applications, and is allowing the download of those Licensed Applications by End-Users, on Your
behalf. However, You are responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold by You using the InApp Purchase API, except for content that is included within the Licensed Application itself (i.e., the In-App
Purchase simply unlocks the content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to section 3.3 of Attachment 2 to the
Agreement. All of the Licensed Applications shall be marketed by Apple, on Your behalf, to End-Users at prices
identified in a price tier and designated by You, in Your sole discretion, from the pricing schedule set forth in
the App Store Connect tool, which may be updated from time to time by Apple. In addition, You may, at Your
election via App Store Connect, instruct Apple to market the Licensed Applications at a discount of 50% of
Your established price tier for authorized institutional customers. You may change the price tier for any
Licensed Application at any time, at Your discretion, in accordance with the pricing schedule set forth in the
App Store Connect tool as may be updated from time to time. As Your agent and/or commissionaire, Apple
shall be solely responsible for the collection of all prices payable by End-Users for Licensed Applications
acquired by those End-Users under this Schedule 2.
3.2
In the event that the sale or delivery of any of the Licensed Applications to any End-User is subject to
any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other similar tax or levy, under
applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Licensed Applications
to End-Users will be determined in accordance with Exhibit B to this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time
via the App Store Connect site. You are solely responsible for selecting and maintaining accurate inputs for tax
categorization for Your Licensed Applications via the App Store Connect site, which may be updated from time
to time. Such tax categorization will be applied to the sale and delivery of Your Licensed Applications. Any
adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Licensed Applications will take effect for future
sales of Licensed Applications after Apple has processed the adjustment within a reasonable period of time.
Adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Licensed Applications will not apply to any sales
of Licensed Applications occurring before Apple has processed Your tax categorization adjustment.

v123
28 August 2023

If the tax categorization of Your Licensed Applications is deemed to be inaccurate by any tax authority, You are
solely responsible for the tax consequences. If Apple deems in its reasonable discretion that the tax
categorization of Your Licensed Applications is inaccurate, Apple reserves the right to hold in trust amounts
owed to You, until such time as You correct the tax categorization. Upon correction of the tax categorization,
Apple will deduct any penalties and interest resulting from the inaccuracy, and remit to You any remaining
amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 2.
You shall indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any
underpayment or overpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or
other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
3.3
In furtherance of the parties’ respective tax compliance obligations, Apple requires that You comply
with the requirements listed on Exhibit C to this Schedule 2 or on App Store Connect depending upon, among
other things, (i) Your region of residence and (ii) the regions designated by You in which You wish Apple to
allow access to the Licensed Applications. In the event that Apple collects any amounts corresponding to the
purchase price for any of Your Licensed Applications before You have provided Apple with any tax
documentation required under Exhibit C to this Schedule 2, Apple may decide to not remit those amounts to
You, and to hold those amounts in trust for You, until such time as You have provided Apple with the required
tax documentation. Upon receipt of all required tax documents from You, Apple will remit to You any amounts
held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, under this Section 3.3, in accordance with the provisions of this
Schedule 2.
3.4
Apple shall be entitled to the following commissions in consideration for its services as Your agent
and/or commissionaire under this Schedule 2:
(a)
For sales of Licensed Applications to End-Users, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to thirty
percent (30%) of all prices payable by each End-User. Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made
by customers who have accrued greater than one year of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group
(as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention Grace Periods or Renewal Extension Periods, Apple
shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each
subsequent renewal. Retention Grace Period refers to the time period between the end of a customer’s
subscription (e.g., due to cancelation or non-payment) and the beginning of a new subscription within the same
Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no greater than 60 days, subject to change. Renewal
Extension Period refers to the time by which You extend the renewal date of the customer’s subscription,
without additional charges. For purposes of determining the commissions to which Apple is entitled under this
Section 3.4(a), the prices payable by End-Users shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in
Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2.
(b)
App Store Small Business Program. For Developers who have qualified and been approved by Apple
for the App Store Small Business Program, Apple shall be entitled to a reduced commission of 15% of all
prices payable by each End-User for sales of Licensed Applications to End-Users located in those regions
listed in Exhibit B of this Schedule 2 as updated from time to time via the App Store Connect site. You may
qualify for approval in the App Store Small Business Program subject to the terms of the Agreement, this
Schedule 2, and the following:
You and Your Associated Developer Accounts must have earned no more than $1,000,000 in total proceeds
(sales net of Apple’s commission and certain taxes and adjustments) during the twelve (12) fiscal months
occurring in the prior calendar year (“calendar year”), as calculated by Apple under standard business
practices.
To enroll in the App Store Small Business Program, You must provide Apple with any requested information
related to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts. If there is a change in Your relationship to an
Associated Developer Account, You must update such information. An “Associated Developer Account” is any
Apple Developer Program account (i) You own or control or (ii) which owns or controls Your account. For
example, as the individual or legal entity who accepted the terms of the Agreement and this Schedule 2, You
have an Associated Developer Account if any of the following apply:

•

You have majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership interest in the ownership or shares of
another Apple Developer Program member account.
v123
28 August 2023

•
•
•

Another Apple Developer Program member has majority (over 50%) corporate, individual, or partnership
interest in the ownership or shares of Your account.
You have ultimate decision-making authority over another Apple Developer Program member account.
Another Apple Developer Program member has ultimate decision-making authority over Your account.

You and Your Associated Developer Accounts must be in good standing as members of the Apple Developer
Program.
Once the total proceeds of You and Your Associated Developer Accounts exceeds $1,000,000 in the current
calendar year, You will be charged the standard commission rate set forth in Section 3.4(a) in this Schedule 2
for the remainder of the calendar year.
Apple will determine eligibility and approve qualified Developers for participation in the App Store Small
Business Program within fifteen (15) days of the end of each fiscal calendar month.
If the total proceeds of You and Your Associated Developer Accounts amount to no more than $1,000,000 in a
future calendar year, You may re-qualify for approval in the App Store Small Business Program in the following
calendar year.
If You participate, either as a Transferor or a Recipient (hereafter referred to as an “App Transfer Party”), in the
transfer of a Licensed Application, the proceeds associated with that Licensed Application will be included in
the calculation of total proceeds of any App Transfer Party to determine eligibility for participation in the App
Store Small Business Program. For example, if You transfer a Licensed Application from Your developer
account to another developer account using the App Store Connect tool, the proceeds associated with that
transferred Licensed Application will be included in the calculation of Your total proceeds and in the calculation
of the total proceeds of the developer account to which you transferred the Licensed Application. If a Licensed
Application is transferred multiple times in a given calendar year, the proceeds associated with that Licensed
Application will be included in the calculation of total proceeds of each and every App Transfer Party.
You and Your Associated Developer Accounts will be disqualified from the App Store Small Business Program
and terminated at Apple’s discretion, if You or Your Associated Developer Accounts engage in any suspicious,
misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission relating to qualification in the App
Store Small Business Program (e.g., providing false or inaccurate information to Apple, creating or using
multiple Apple Developer Program accounts to improperly benefit from the App Store Small Business
Program).
Apple may withhold payments due to You and Your Associated Developer Accounts for violations of this
provision.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 2, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions
specified in Section 3.4 hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all
taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any End-User relating to the delivery or use of the Licensed
Applications. For sales of Licensed Applications developed by Apple, Apple is not entitled to a commission.
3.5
Upon collection of any amounts from any End-User as the price for any Licensed Application delivered
to that End-User hereunder, Apple shall deduct the full amount of its commission with respect to that Licensed
Application, and any taxes collected by Apple under Section 3.2 and 3.4 hereof, and shall remit to You, or issue
a credit in Your favor, as the case may be, the remainder of those prices in accordance with Apple standard
business practices, including the following: remittance payments (i) are made by means of wire transfer only;
(ii) are subject to minimum monthly remittance amount thresholds; (iii) require You to provide certain
remittance-related information on the App Store Connect site; and (iv) subject to the foregoing requirements,
will be made no later than forty-five (45) days following the close of the monthly period in which the
corresponding amount was received by Apple from the End-User. No later than forty-five (45) days following
the end of each monthly period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report
in sufficient detail to permit You to identify the Licensed Applications sold in that monthly period and the total
amount to be remitted to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a
commission, in accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Licensed Application to any End-User,
v123
28 August 2023

even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Licensed Application from that End-User. In the event that
the purchase price received by Apple from any End-User for any Licensed Application is in a currency other
than the remittance currency agreed between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Licensed Application
shall be converted to the remittance currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be
determined, in accordance with an exchange rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in the App Store
Connect tool as may be updated from time to time, pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 2. Apple may
provide a means on App Store Connect to enable You to designate a primary currency for the bank account
designated by You for receiving remittances (“Designated Currency”). Apple may cause Apple's bank to
convert all remittances in any remittance currency other than the Designated Currency into the Designated
Currency prior to remittance to You. You agree that any resulting currency exchange differentials or fees
charged by Apple's bank may be deducted from such remittances. You remain responsible for any fees (e.g.,
wire transfer fees) charged by Your bank or any intermediary banks between Your bank and Apple’s bank.
3.6
In the event that Apple’s commission or any price payable by any End-User for any of the Licensed
Applications is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any sales, use, goods and services, value
added, telecommunications or other tax or levy not collected by Apple under Section 3.2 hereof; or (iii) any
other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely for Your
account, and shall not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled under this Schedule 2.
3.7
In the event that any remittance made by Apple to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the
full amount of that withholding or similar tax shall be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the
commission to which Apple is entitled on that transaction. If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due,
Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will
pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of
withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such
documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish
Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in
writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to
You the amount of Apple’s payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your
behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority
for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon,
including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to
Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.
3.8
You may offer auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories using the In-App Purchase API subject
to the terms of this Schedule 2, provided that:
(a)
Auto-renew functionality must be on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly, semi-annual or annual
basis at prices You select in the App Store Connect tool. You may offer multiple durations and service levels
for Your subscription and will have the ability to associate and rank these subscription items within Subscription
Groups, to enable customers to easily upgrade, downgrade, and cross-grade amongst the Subscription Group
options. You understand and agree that when a subscriber upgrades or cross-grades (except for cross-grades
of different durations), such service level will begin immediately and Your proceeds will be adjusted
accordingly, and when a subscriber downgrades, the new service will begin at the end of the current
subscription period.
(b)
You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following information regarding Your autorenewing subscription:
•
•
•

Title of auto-renewing subscription, which may be the same as the in-app product name
Length of subscription
Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate

Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use must be accessible within Your Licensed Application.
(c)
You must fulfill the offer during the entire subscription period, as marketed, including any Billing Grace
Period You authorize, and, in the event You breach this section 3.8(c) of Schedule 2, You hereby authorize
and instruct Apple to refund to the End-User the full amount, or any portion thereof in Apple’s sole discretion, of
v123
28 August 2023

the price paid by the End-User for that subscription. Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which
Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event
that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount
equal to the price for that subscription. You acknowledge that Apple may exercise its rights under section 7.3 of
this Schedule 2 for repeated violations of this provision.
3.9
When You make price changes to an existing subscription item, You may elect to retain current pricing
for Your existing customers by indicating Your intent in the App Store Connect tool. When You increase pricing
for existing subscribers in regions that require end-user consent, they will be prompted to review and agree to
the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.
3.10
To the extent You promote and offer for sale auto-renewing subscriptions, within or outside of Your
Licensed Application, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.
3.11

Subscription services purchased within Licensed Applications must use In-App Purchase.

In addition to using the In-App Purchase API, a Licensed Application may read or play content (magazines,
newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Licensed Application (such as, by way of
example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content
within the Licensed Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of
the Licensed Application.
3.12
If Your Licensed Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may
provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User’s account when they
purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the
provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products
and do so in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily viewed
and is consented to in Your Licensed Application. You may offer a free incentive to extend the subscription if
the user agrees to send this information.
3.13
You may use Subscription Offer Codes to promote your auto-renewing subscriptions in select
Territories subject to the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 2, and the following:
(a)
Subscription Offer Code means a code provided by Apple to You, pursuant to these terms, which
allows an End-User to whom You provide one or more Subscription Offer Codes to download or access Your
Licensed Application.
(b)
Upon request by You via the App Store Connect tool, Apple shall deliver the Subscription Offer Codes
electronically to You. Subscription Offer Codes will become active for use by End-Users upon delivery to You.
You may not distribute Subscription Offer Codes that are no longer active to End-Users in any Territory in
which You are not permitted to sell or distribute Your Licensed Application.
You shall not export any Subscription Offer Code for use outside the Territories nor represent that You have
the right or ability to do so.
Risk of loss and transfer of title for the Subscription Offer Codes pass to You upon delivery to You.
You shall comply with all applicable laws in the Territories in which You distribute Subscription Offer Codes.
(c)
Apple shall not be responsible for developing or producing any materials in relation to the Subscription
Offer Codes other than the Subscription Offer Codes themselves.
You shall not sell the Subscription Offer Codes or accept any form of payment, trade-in-kind, or other
compensation in connection with the distribution of the Subscription Offer Codes and You shall prohibit third
parties from doing so.

v123
28 August 2023

During the period when a Subscription Offer Code allows an End-User to access a subscription in Your
Licensed Application for free, You hereby waive any right to collect any royalties, proceeds, or remuneration
for such access, regardless of whether any remuneration would otherwise be payable under the Agreement,
this Schedule 2, and Schedule 1 thereto, if applicable. The parties acknowledge that, as between Apple and
You, the parties’ respective responsibilities for the payment of any royalties or other similar payments to third
parties with respect to End-Users accessing subscriptions in your Licensed Application via the Subscription
Offer Codes shall be as set forth in the Agreement and this Schedule 2.
You shall be solely responsible for Your use of the Subscription Offer Codes, including any use by other
members of Your App Store Connect team, and for any loss or liability to You or Apple therefrom.
In the event Your Licensed Application is removed from the App Store for any reason, You agree to cease
distribution of all Subscription Offer Codes and that Apple may deactivate such Subscription Offer Codes.
You agree that Apple shall have the right to deactivate the Subscription Offer Codes, even if already delivered
to End-Users, in the event You violate any of the terms in the Agreement or this Schedule 2.
(d)
You must include the following Subscription Offer Code End-User terms in any instrument used to
distribute the Subscription Offer Codes to End-Users (e.g., certificate, card, e-mail, coupons, online posts): (i)
The code expiration date or while supplies last; (ii) The Territory in which the codes can be redeemed; (iii)
Apple ID is required, subject to prior acceptance of license and usage terms; (iv) Codes are not for resale, and
have no cash value; (v) Full terms apply; see https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/; and (vi)
Offer and content are provided by You.
3.14
Where available, You may offer multiple Licensed Applications offered by You in a single collection
(“Bundle”) to End-Users at a price tier designated by You as set forth in the App Store Connect tool as may be
updated from time to time. Furthermore, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to enable users who have
purchased some but not all Licensed Applications in a Bundle to access and download the remaining items in
the Bundle (“Complete My Bundle” or “CMB”) for the CMB Price. You will receive proceeds for the CMB Price,
which shall equal the Bundle Price set by You less the sum of the retail prices paid by the user for previously
purchased Licensed Applications. In the event the CMB Price is less than Tier 1 and greater than zero under
the price tiers set forth in the App Store Connect tool, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to set the CMB
Price for that user at Tier 1. In the event the CMB Price is less than zero, You hereby authorize and instruct
Apple to provide the remaining Licensed Applications in the Bundle to the End-User without charge. Each CMB
transaction will be reflected in Your statement as follows: (i) a new sale of the full Bundle at the price paid for
the Bundle, identified as a CMB sale; and (ii) a return (i.e., a negative transaction) for each eligible purchased
Licensed Application contained in the Bundle in the amount previously paid for the Licensed Application, each
identified as a CMB return. Bundles offered at Tier 0 must offer an auto-renewing subscription service
pursuant to Section 3.8 of this Schedule 2 in each Licensed Application included in the Bundle, and users who
purchase such subscription service from within one app in the Bundle must be able to access that subscription
service in each of the other Licensed Applications in the Bundle at no additional cost.

This Schedule 2, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or

developers.
7.2
In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Licensed Applications, or to
authorize Apple to allow access to those Licensed Applications by End-Users, in accordance with this
Schedule 2, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Licensed Applications from the App Store
using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You under
this Section 7.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 2, or any liability
to Apple and/or any End-User with respect to those Licensed Applications.
7.3
Apple reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing download by End-Users of the
Licensed Applications at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without

limitation upon notice received under applicable laws, that: (i) those Licensed Applications are not authorized
for export to one or more of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the Export Administration
Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Licensed Applications and/or any End-User’s possession and/or use
of those Licensed Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property
rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution, sale and/or use of those Licensed Applications violates any
applicable law in any region You designated under Section 2.1 of this Schedule 2; (iv) You have violated the
terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 2, or other documentation including without limitation the App Store
Review Guidelines; (v) Your Licensed Applications violate Section 5.4 of this Schedule 2, including without
limitation upon notice by a regulator of an alleged violation; or (vi) You or anyone representing You or Your
company are subject to sanctions of any region in which Apple operates. An election by Apple to cease the
marketing and allowing download of any Licensed Applications, pursuant to this Section 7.3, shall not relieve
You of Your obligations under this Schedule 2.
v123
28 August 2023

You may withdraw any or all of the Licensed Applications from the App Store, at any time, and for any
7.4
reason, by using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site, except that, with respect to Your EndUsers, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 2, which
shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 5.1
and 7.2 of this Schedule 2.

discovery for content on Apple-branded hardware.
2.2
All Custom Applications will be delivered by You to Apple using software tools, a secure FTP site
address and/or such other delivery methods as prescribed by Apple.
2.3
You hereby certify that all of the Custom Applications You deliver to Apple under this Schedule 3 are
authorized for export from the United States to each of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the
requirements of all applicable laws, including but not limited to the United States Export Administration
Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774. You further represent and warrant that all versions of the Custom
Applications You deliver to Apple are not subject to the International Traffic In Arms Regulations 22 C.F.R.
Parts 120-130 and are not designed, made, modified or configured for any military end users or end uses.
Without limiting the generality of this Section 2.3, You certify that (i) none of the Custom Applications contains,
uses or supports any data encryption or cryptographic functions; or (ii) in the event that any Custom Application
contains, uses or supports any such data encryption or cryptographic functionality, You will upon request
provide Apple with PDF copies of export classification ruling (CCATS) issued by the United States Commerce
Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) or any self-classification reports submitted to the BIS, and
appropriate authorizations from other regions that mandate import authorizations for that Custom Application,
as required. You acknowledge that Apple is relying upon Your certification in this Section 2.3 in allowing EndUsers to access and download the Custom Applications under this Schedule 3. Except as provided in this

providing any content restriction tools or age verification functionality before enabling end-users to access

Delivery of the Custom Applications to End-Users

3.1
You acknowledge and agree that Apple, in the course of acting as agent and/or commissionaire for
You, is hosting the Custom Applications, providing Content Codes to Custom App Distribution Customers, and
is allowing the download of the Custom Applications by End-Users, on Your behalf. However, You are
responsible for hosting and delivering content or services sold by You using the In-App Purchase API, except
for content that is included within the Custom Application itself (i.e., the In-App Purchase simply unlocks the
content) or content hosted by Apple pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Program Agreement. All of the Custom
Applications shall be marketed by Apple, on Your behalf, to End-User Custom App Distribution Customers at
prices identified in a price tier and designated by You, in Your sole discretion, from the pricing schedule set
forth in the App Store Connect tool, which may be updated from time to time by Apple. You may change the
price tier for any Custom Application at any time, at Your discretion, in accordance with the pricing schedule set
forth in the App Store Connect tool. As Your agent and/or commissionaire, Apple shall be solely responsible for
the collection of all prices payable by Custom App Distribution Customers for Custom Applications acquired by
End-Users under this Schedule 3.
3.2
In the event that the sale or delivery of any of the Custom Applications to any End-User is subject to
any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or other similar tax or levy, under
applicable law, responsibility for the collection and remittance of that tax for sales of the Custom Applications to
End-Users will be determined in accordance with Exhibit B to this Schedule 3 as updated from time to time via
the App Store Connect site. You are solely responsible for selecting and maintaining accurate inputs for tax
categorization for Your Custom Applications via the App Store Connect site, which may be updated from time
v123
28 August 2023

to time. Such tax categorization will be applied to the sale and delivery of Your Custom Applications. Any
adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Custom Applications will take effect for future
sales of Custom Applications after Apple has processed the adjustment within a reasonable period of time.
Adjustments that You make to the tax categorization for Your Custom Applications will not apply to any sales of
Custom Applications occurring before Apple has processed Your tax categorization adjustment.
If the tax categorization of Your Custom Applications is deemed to be inaccurate by any tax authority, You are
solely responsible for the tax consequences. If Apple deems in its reasonable discretion that the tax
categorization of Your Custom Applications is inaccurate, Apple reserves the right to hold in trust amounts
owed to You, until such time as You correct the tax categorization. Upon correction of the tax categorization,
Apple will deduct any penalties and interest resulting from the inaccuracy, and remit to You any remaining
amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule 3.
You shall indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for any
underpayment or overpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added, telecommunications or
other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest thereon.
3.3
In furtherance of the parties’ respective tax compliance obligations, Apple requires that You comply
with the requirements listed on Exhibit C to this Schedule 3 or on App Store Connect depending upon, among
other things, (i) Your region of residence, and (ii) the regions designated by You in which You wish Apple to
allow sale of and access to the Custom Applications. In the event that Apple collects any amounts
corresponding to the purchase price for any of Your Custom Applications before You have provided Apple with
any tax documentation required under Exhibit C to this Schedule 3, Apple may decide to not remit those
amounts to You, and to hold those amounts in trust for You, until such time as You have provided Apple with
the required tax documentation. Upon receipt of all required tax documents from You, Apple will remit to You
any amounts held in trust by Apple for You, without interest, under this Section 3.3, in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule 3.
3.4
Apple shall be entitled to the following commissions in consideration for its services as Your agent
and/or commissionaire under this Schedule 3:
For sales of Custom Applications to Custom App Distribution Customers, Apple shall be entitled to a
commission equal to thirty percent (30%) of all prices payable by each Custom App Distribution Customer.
Solely for auto-renewing subscription purchases made by customers who have accrued greater than one year
of paid subscription service within a Subscription Group (as defined below) and notwithstanding any Retention
Grace Periods or Renewal Extension Periods, Apple shall be entitled to a commission equal to fifteen percent
(15%) of all prices payable by each End-User for each subsequent renewal. Retention Grace Period refers to
the time period between the end of a customer’s subscription (e.g. due to cancelation or non-payment) and the
beginning of a new subscription within the same Subscription Group, provided that such time period is no
greater than 60 days, subject to change. Renewal Extension Period refers to the time by which You extend the
renewal date of the customer’s subscription, without additional charges. For purposes of determining the
commissions to which Apple is entitled under this Section 3.4, the prices payable by Custom App Distribution
Customers shall be net of any and all taxes collected, as provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 3.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.2 of this Schedule 3, Apple shall be entitled to the commissions
specified in Section 3.4 hereof without reduction for any taxes or other government levies, including any and all
taxes or other, similar obligations of You, Apple or any Custom App Distribution Customer relating to the
delivery or use of the Custom Applications. For sales of Licensed Applications and/or Custom Applications
developed by Apple, Apple is not entitled to a commission.
3.5
Upon collection of any amounts from any Custom App Distribution Customer as the price for any
Custom Application delivered to that Custom App Distribution Customer’s designated End-Users hereunder,
Apple shall deduct the full amount of its commission with respect to that Custom Application, and any taxes
collected by Apple under Section 3.2 and 3.4 hereof, and shall remit to You, or issue a credit in Your favor, as
the case may be, the remainder of those prices in accordance with Apple standard business practices,
including the following: remittance payments (i) are made by means of wire transfer only; (ii) are subject to
minimum monthly remittance amount thresholds; (iii) require You to provide certain remittance-related
information on the App Store Connect site; and (iv) subject to the foregoing requirements, will be made no later
than forty-five (45) days following the close of the monthly period in which the corresponding amount was
v123
28 August 2023

received by Apple from the End-User. No later than forty-five (45) days following the end of each monthly
period, Apple will make available to You on the App Store Connect site a sales report in sufficient detail to
permit You to identify the Custom Applications sold in that monthly period and the total amount to be remitted
to You by Apple. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Apple shall be entitled to a commission, in
accordance with this Section 3.5 on the delivery of any Content Codes to any Custom App Distribution
Customer, even if Apple is unable to collect the price for that Custom Application from the Custom App
Distribution Customer. In the event that the purchase price received by Apple from any Custom App
Distribution Customer for any Custom Application is in a currency other than the remittance currency agreed
between Apple and You, the purchase price for that Custom Application shall be converted to the remittance
currency, and the amount to be remitted by Apple to You shall be determined, in accordance with an exchange
rate fixed for the Delivery Period, as reflected in the App Store Connect tool, as may be updated from time to
time, pursuant to section 3.1 of this Schedule 3. Apple may provide a means on App Store Connect to enable
You to designate a primary currency for the bank account designated by You for receiving remittances
(“Designated Currency”). Apple may cause Apple’s bank to convert all remittances in any remittance currency
other than the Designated Currency into the Designated Currency prior to remittance to You. You agree that
any resulting currency exchange differentials or fees charged by Apple’s bank may be deducted from such
remittances. You remain responsible for any fees (e.g., wire transfer fees) charged by Your bank or any
intermediary banks between Your bank and Apple’s bank.
3.6
In the event that Apple’s commission or any price payable by any Custom App Distribution Customer
for any of the Custom Applications is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; or (ii) any sales, use, goods
and services, value added, telecommunications or other tax or levy not collected by Apple under Section 3.2
hereof; or (iii) any other tax or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall
be solely for Your account, and shall not reduce the commission to which Apple is entitled under this Schedule
3.
3.7
In the event that any remittance made by Apple to You is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the
full amount of that withholding or similar tax shall be solely for Your account, and will not reduce the
commission to which Apple is entitled on that transaction. If Apple reasonably believes that such tax is due,
Apple will deduct the full amount of such withholding or similar tax from the gross amount owed to You, and will
pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities. Apple will apply a reduced rate of
withholding tax, if any, provided for in any applicable income tax treaty only if You furnish Apple with such
documentation required under that income tax treaty or otherwise satisfactory to Apple, sufficient to establish
Your entitlement to the benefit of that reduced rate of withholding tax. Upon Your timely request to Apple in
writing, using means reasonably designated by Apple, Apple will use commercially practical efforts to report to
You the amount of Apple’s payment of withholding or similar taxes to the competent tax authorities on Your
behalf. You will indemnify and hold Apple harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority
for any underpayment of any such withholding or similar taxes, and any penalties and/or interest thereon,
including, but not limited to, underpayments attributable to any erroneous claim or representation by You as to
Your entitlement to, or Your disqualification for, the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding tax.
3.8
You may offer auto-renewing subscriptions in select Territories using the In-App Purchase API subject
to the terms of this Schedule 3, provided that:
(a)
Auto-renew functionality must be on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, tri-monthly, semi-annual, or annual
basis at prices You select in the App Store Connect tool. You may, however, offer more than one option.
(b)
You clearly and conspicuously disclose to users the following information regarding Your autorenewing subscription:
•
•
•

Title of auto-renewing subscription, which may be the same as the in-app product name
Length of subscription
Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate

Links to Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use must be accessible within Your Licensed Application or
Custom Application.

v123
28 August 2023

(c)
You must fulfill the offer during the entire subscription period, as marketed, including any Billing Grace
period You authorize, and, in the event You breach this section 3.8(c) of Schedule 3, You hereby authorize and
instruct Apple to refund to the End-User the full amount, or any portion thereof in Apple’s sole discretion, of the
price paid by the End-User for that subscription. Billing Grace Period refers to the period during which
Developers agree to provide paid service for free to users who do not recover from a billing error. In the event
that Apple refunds any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount
equal to the price for that subscription. You acknowledge that Apple may exercise its rights under section 7.3 of
this Schedule 3 for repeated violations of this provision.
3.9
When You make price changes to an existing subscription item, You may elect to retain current pricing
for Your existing customers by indicating Your intent in the App Store Connect tool. When You increase pricing
for existing subscribers in regions that require end-user consent, they will be prompted to review and agree to
the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.
3.10
To the extent You promote and offer for sale auto-renewing subscriptions within or outside of Your
Custom Application, You must do so in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements.
3.11
Subscription services purchased within Custom Applications must use In-App Purchase, which will be
charged to the End-User iTunes account, not the Custom App Distribution Customer account.
In addition to using the In-App Purchase API, a Custom Application may read or play content (magazines,
newspapers, books, audio, music, video) that is offered outside of the Custom Application (such as, by way of
example, through Your website) provided that You do not link to or market external offers for such content
within the Custom Application. You are responsible for authentication access to content acquired outside of
the Custom Application.
3.12
If Your Custom Application is periodical content-based (e.g. magazines and newspapers), Apple may
provide You with the name, email address, and zip code associated with an End-User’s account when they
purchase an auto-renewing subscription via the In-App Purchase API, provided that such user consents to the
provision of data to You, and further provided that You may only use such data to promote Your own products
and otherwise in strict compliance with Your publicly posted Privacy Policy, a copy of which must be readily
viewed through and is consented to in Your Custom Application. You may offer a free incentive to extend the
subscription if the user agrees to send this information.

Ownership and End-User Licensing

4.1
The parties acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not acquire any ownership interest in or to any of
the Custom Applications or Licensed Application Information, and title, risk of loss, responsibility for, and
control over the Custom Applications shall, at all times, remain with You. Apple may not use any of the Custom
Applications or Licensed Application Information for any purpose, or in any manner, except as specifically
authorized in this Schedule 3.
4.2
You may deliver to Apple Your own EULA for any Custom Application at the time that You deliver that
Custom Application to Apple, in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3; provided, however, that Your
EULA must include and may not be inconsistent with the minimum terms and conditions specified on Exhibit D
to this Schedule 3, and must comply with all applicable laws in the United States. Apple shall allow each EndUser to which Apple allows access to any such Custom Application to review Your EULA (if any) at the time
that Apple delivers that Custom Application to that End-User, and Apple shall notify each End-User that the
End-User’s use of that Custom Application is subject to the terms and conditions of Your EULA (if any). In the
event that You do not furnish Your own EULA for any Custom Application to Apple, You acknowledge and
agree that each End-User’s use of that Custom Application shall be subject to Apple’s standard EULA (which is
part of the App Store Terms of Service).
4.3
You hereby acknowledge that the EULA for each of the Custom Applications is solely between You
and the End-User and conforms to applicable law, and Apple shall not be responsible for, and shall not have
any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by You or any End-User of any of the terms and
conditions of any EULA.

Applications, or Apple’s or End-Users’ permitted uses of those Custom Applications, violate or infringe any
patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of any other person,
firm, corporation or other entity and that You are not submitting the Custom Applications to Apple on behalf of
one or more third parties other than under license grant from one or more Custom App Distribution Customers;
(c) each of the Custom Applications is authorized for distribution, sale and use in, export to, and import into
each of the regions designated by You pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Schedule 3, in accordance with the laws
and regulations of those regions and all applicable export/import regulations; (d) none of the Custom

Custom Applications or use of Your intellectual property in connection with the Custom App Distribution Site,
You agree to permit Apple to share Your contact information with the party filing such dispute and to follow
Apple’s app dispute process on a non-exclusive basis and without any party waiving its legal rights.
5.2
You shall use the software rating tool set forth on App Store Connect to supply information regarding
each of the Custom Applications delivered by You for marketing and fulfillment by Apple through the Custom
App Distribution Site under this Schedule 3 in order to assign a rating to each such Custom Application. For
purposes of assigning a rating to each of the Custom Applications, You shall use Your best efforts to provide
correct and complete information about the content of that Custom Application with the software rating tool.
You acknowledge and agree that Apple is relying on: (i) Your good faith and diligence in accurately and
completely providing requested information for each Custom Application; and (ii) Your representations and
warranties in Section 5.1 hereof, in making that Custom Application available for download by End-Users in
each of the regions You designated hereunder. Furthermore, You authorize Apple to correct the rating of any
Custom Application of Yours that has been assigned an incorrect rating; and You agree to any such corrected
rating.
5.3
In the event that any region You designated hereunder requires the approval of, or rating of, any
Custom Application by any government or industry regulatory agency as a condition for the distribution, sale
and/or use of that Custom Application, You acknowledge and agree that Apple may elect not to make that
Custom Application available for purchase by Custom App Distribution Customers and/or download by EndUsers in that region from the Custom App Distribution Site.
5.4 Custom Applications that are targeted at children or otherwise likely to appeal to children, and which
pressure children to make purchases (including, but not limited to, phrases such as “buy now” or “upgrade
now”) or persuade others to make purchases for them, should not be made available in any Territory that has
deemed such marketing practices illegal. You expressly accept and agree to take full responsibility for Your
Custom Applications’ compliance with applicable laws pursuant to Section 5.1(c) of this Schedule 3, including
without limitation consumer protection, marketing, and gaming laws. For more information on legal
requirements of regions in the European Union, see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/consumermarketing/unfairtrade/index_en.htm.

Apple shall have no responsibility for the installation and/or use of any of the Custom Applications by
any End-User. You shall be solely responsible for any and all product warranties, End-User assistance and
product support with respect to each of the Custom Applications.
6.2
You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with
respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, or
attributable to, the Custom Applications and/or the use of those Custom Applications by any End-User,
including, but not limited to: (i) claims of breach of warranty, whether specified in the EULA or established

In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from any End-User that: (i) the End-User wishes to
cancel its license to any of the Custom Applications within ninety (90) days of the date of download of that
Custom Application by that End-User or the end of the auto-renewing subscription period offered pursuant to
section 3.8 if such period is less than ninety (90) days; or (ii) a Custom Application fails to conform to Your
specifications or Your product warranty or the requirements of any applicable law, Apple may refund to the
Custom App Distribution Customer and/or End-User, as applicable, the full amount of the price paid by the
Custom App Distribution Customer or End-User for that Custom Application. In the event that Apple refunds
any such price to an End-User, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for, an amount equal to the price
for that Custom Application. In the event that Apple receives any notice or claim from a payment provider that
an End-User has obtained a refund for a Custom Application, You shall reimburse, or grant Apple a credit for,

7.

Termination

7.1
This Schedule 3, and all of Apple’s obligations hereunder, shall terminate upon the expiration or
termination of the Agreement. Notwithstanding any such termination, Apple shall be entitled to: (i) all
commissions on all Content Codes redeemable for copies of the Custom Applications provided to Custom App
Distribution Customers prior to the date of termination (including the phase-out period set forth in Section 1.4
hereof); and (ii) reimbursement from You of refunds paid by Apple to Custom App Distribution Customers
and/or End-Users, whether before or after the date of termination, in accordance with Section 6.3 of this
Schedule 3. When the Agreement terminates, Apple may withhold all payments due to You for a period that
Apple determines is reasonable in order to calculate and offset any Custom App Distribution Customer and/or
End-User refunds. If at any time Apple determines or suspects that You or any developers with which You are
affiliated have engaged in, or encouraged or participated with other developers to engage in, any suspicious,
misleading, fraudulent, improper, unlawful or dishonest act or omission, Apple may withhold payments due to
You or such other developers.
7.2
In the event that You no longer have the legal right to distribute the Custom Applications, or to
authorize Apple to allow access to those Custom Applications by End-Users, in accordance with this Schedule
3, You shall promptly notify Apple and withdraw those Custom Applications from the Custom App Distribution
Site using the tools provided on the App Store Connect tool; provided, however, that such withdrawal by You
under this Section 7.2 shall not relieve You of any of Your obligations to Apple under this Schedule 3, or any
liability to Apple and/or any End-User with respect to those Custom Applications.
7.3
Apple reserves the right to cease marketing, offering, and allowing purchase by Custom App
Distribution Customers and download by End-Users of the Custom Applications at any time, with or without
cause, by providing notice of termination to You. Without limiting the generality of this Section 7.3, You
acknowledge that Apple may cease the marketing and allowing download by End-Users of some or all of the
Custom Applications if Apple reasonably believes, based on human and/or systematic review, and, including
without limitation upon notice received under applicable laws, that: (i) those Custom Applications are not
authorized for export to one or more of the regions listed on Exhibit A, in accordance with the Export
Administration Regulations or other restrictions; (ii) those Custom Applications and/or any End-User’s
possession and/or use of those Custom Applications, infringe patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or
other intellectual property rights of any third party; (iii) the distribution, sale and/or use of those Custom
Applications violates any applicable law in any region You designated pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Schedule
3; (iv) You have violated the terms of the Agreement, this Schedule 3, or other documentation including without
limitation the App Store Review Guidelines; (v) Your Custom Applications violate Section 5.4 of this Schedule
3, including without limitation upon notice by a regulator of an alleged violation; or (vi) You or anyone
representing You or Your company are subject to sanctions of any region in which Apple operates. An election
by Apple to cease the marketing and allowing download of any Custom Applications, pursuant to this Section
7.3, shall not relieve You of Your obligations under this Schedule 3.
7.4
You may withdraw any or all of the Custom Applications from the Custom App Distribution Site, at any
time, and for any reason, by using the tools provided on the App Store Connect site, except that, with respect
v123
28 August 2023

to Your End-Users, You hereby authorize and instruct Apple to fulfill any outstanding Content Code redemption
requests by End-Users and to fulfill sections 1.2(b), (c), and (d) of this Schedule 3, which shall survive
termination or expiration of the Agreement unless You indicate otherwise pursuant to sections 5.1 and 7.2 of
this Schedule 3.
